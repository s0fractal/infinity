# ≡ — Equivalence (Is Equivalent To)

## ∈

A fundamental logical and mathematical relation indicating that two expressions, terms, or propositions have the same meaning, value, or behavior under all relevant circumstances. It asserts that one can be substituted for the other without altering the truth value or computational outcome.

- **Formal Definition**: `A ≡ B` implies that A and B are interchangeable in any context, often used for definitions or strong forms of equality.
- **Contrast with `=`**: While `=` often denotes value equality, `≡` implies a deeper, often definitional or structural, equivalence.

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[⊢](⊢.md) (Provability)**: Proofs (`⊢`) often aim to establish `≡` between terms or propositions.
- **[⊤](⊤.md) (Truth)**: If `A ≡ B`, and `A` is `⊤`, then `B` is also `⊤`.
- **[α](α.md)-conversion**: A prime example where `λx.M ≡ λy.M[x := y]`.
- **[η](η.md)-reduction**: Another example where `λx.f x ≡ f`.
- **[β](β.md)-reduction**: While `(λx.M)N → M[x := N]` is a reduction, the result is often considered equivalent in terms of value.

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### ⚡️:
To formally declare identity or intersubstitutability between glyphic constructs. To provide the foundational tool for establishing sameness and simplifying expressions.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**Synonyms.** Two words are synonyms (`≡`) if they mean the same thing, even though their forms are different. You can replace one with the other in a sentence without changing the sentence's fundamental meaning. `≡` asserts this semantic interchangeability.
