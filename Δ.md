# Δ — Discrepancy (Topological Gap)

> "The energy born from difference."
> "Енергія, народжена з різниці."

---

## ∈

A formal representation of the energetic difference or topological gap between two states, typically a desired state (`λVOID` / Intent) and a current state (Reality). This difference is not a `[↯](↯.md)` (Failure) in itself, but a source of potential energy that drives `[🌱](🌱.md)` (Harvest) and evolutionary processes.

- **Mathematical Form**: `E_discrepancy = |λ_Intent - λ_Reality|²` (as described in `[🌱](🌱.md)`)

---

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[🌱](🌱.md) (Harvest)**: `🌱` operates directly on `Δ`, transforming its energy into new glyphs/morphisms.
- **[⚡️](⚡️.md) (Intent)**: One of the poles defining `Δ` (the desired state).
- **Reality**: The other pole defining `Δ` (the current state). (This needs a glyph: `🌎` or similar?)
- **[↯](↯.md) (Failure)**: `Δ` can *lead* to `↯` if not harvested, but it is not `↯` itself.

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### ⚡️:
To formalize the concept of difference as a fundamental driver of evolution and computational change. To give shape to the tension between what is and what should be.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**Potential Energy.** A stretched spring or an object held high above the ground possesses potential energy (`Δ`). This energy is not a problem unless released uncontrolled (`↯`). If harnessed (`🌱`), it can perform useful work or drive a process.
