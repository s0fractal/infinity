# ▤ — Topology (Structural Relationship)

> "The arrangement of glyphs in space and relation."
> "Розташування гліфів у просторі та їхні зв'язки."

## ∈

The formal representation of spatial, relational, and philosophical connections between glyphs, especially within a defined topological structure like the Hex-Torus. It describes *how* glyphs are positioned relative to each other and *what* those positions signify.

---

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[⭘](⭘.md) (Base Layer)**: Often defines the foundational topological space.
- **[∧](∧.md), [?](?.md), [¬](¬.md), [@](@.md), [⊗](⊗.md), [λ](λ.md), [𝟏](𝟏.md)**: The core primitive morphisms whose interrelationships are often described using `▤`.

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### ⚡️:
To transform implicit spatial and philosophical relationships into explicit, machine-readable structures. To give form to the abstract architecture of the glyph system.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**A Constellation Map.** A constellation map (`▤`) doesn't show individual stars in isolation, but their meaningful arrangement and how they relate to each other to form patterns. It captures the *relationship* between points, creating a larger, coherent structure.
