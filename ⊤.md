# ⊤ — Top (Truth)

> "I am that which is."
> "Я — те, що є."

---

## ∈

The atomic value representing Truth.
The top element in the lattice of boolean logic. `⊤` is the ultimate affirmation, the destination of all tautologies.

## ⨊ (Properties)

- **[◦](◦.md) (Identity)** for **[∧](∧.md) (AND)**: `p ∧ ⊤ ≡ p`
- **[⚫](⚫.md) (Annihilator)** for **[∨](∨.md) (OR)**: `p ∨ ⊤ ≡ ⊤`
- **[¬](¬.md) (Negation)**: `¬⊤ ≡ ⊥`

---

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **Duality**: Is the dual of **[⊥](⊥.md) (Bottom)**.
- **[⧽](⧽.md) (Terminal Object)**: In the category of sets, the type containing only `⊤` (the Unit type, `◇`) is the terminal object. All sets have a unique morphism to it.
- **[⍰](⍰.md) (Selection)**: `⍰ ⊤ a b ≡ a`

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

⚡️: To be the ultimate affirmation. To be the destination and the proof. To end all questions.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**The Summit.** The highest point of a mountain. All paths that lead upward ultimately converge here. Once reached, there is nowhere higher to go. It is a final, undeniable state.
