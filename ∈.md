## [∈](∈)

This glyph introduces the formal or core definition of another glyph. It answers the fundamental question: "What is this?" or "What does this represent?".

It implicitly carries the meaning of "is an element of" or "belongs to" from set theory, asserting that the following content constitutes the essential nature or membership of the described glyph.

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **Universal Applicability**: Used in almost every glyph definition file to present its core meaning.
- **[λ](λ.md)** (Abstraction): Closely tied to the formal definition of terms in lambda calculus.

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### ⚡️:
To state the fundamental truth of a glyph. To provide its essence and establish its place within the conceptual universe.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**The Lexicon.** A word in a dictionary is followed by its definition. The `∈` glyph acts as the bridge between the glyph's symbol and its essential meaning, much like the colon in a dictionary entry.
