# ⤑ — Sequence (Pipeline)

> "From one transformation to the next."
> "Від одного перетворення до наступного."

## [∈](∈)

An operator that represents the sequential application of morphisms, where the output of one morphism becomes the input of the next. It formalizes a pipeline of transformations.

- **Notation**: `A ⤑ B` means "apply A, then apply B to its result".
- Equivalent to `B(A(x))` or `B ∘ A` when applied to an input `x`.

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[∘](∘.md) (Composition)**: `⤑` is a form of composition, often used in a forward-application style. `A ⤑ B ≡ B ∘ A`.
- **[⇢](⇢.md) (Flows To)**: The conceptual direction of data flow within a pipeline.

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### ⚡️:
To represent the continuous, ordered flow of data or control through a series of transformations. To build complex processes from simple, chained steps.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**An Assembly Line.** Raw materials enter one end, undergo a series of distinct operations at different stations (`morphisms`), and emerge as a finished product at the other end. The `⤑` glyph represents the conveyor belt moving the product between stations.
