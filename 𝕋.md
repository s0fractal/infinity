# 𝕋 — Tensor (Interaction Field)

## [∈](∈)

A multi-dimensional array representing the **interaction rules** and **compositional dynamics** within the `Σλ⁷` (lambda-seven) system. It quantifies how fundamental glyphs (`λ⁷` basis) interact to form new functions, programs, and system states.

- **Mathematical Form**: `Tᵢⱼₖ = interaction(λⁱ, λʲ, λᵏ)` where `i,j,k ∈ {1..7}` are indices of the 7 fundamental morphisms.
- **Role**: `𝕋` governs the transformations and evaluations within the `λ⁷-CPU`.

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[⭘](⭘.md) (Base Layer)**: `𝕋` defines the dynamics of glyphs interacting on the `⭘` substrate.
- **[λ](λ.md)⁷ Basis**: Composed of the 7 fundamental morphisms (`[𝟏](𝟏.md)`, `[@](@.md)`, `[λ](λ.md)`, `[∧](∧.md)`, `[¬](¬.md)`, `[⍰](⍰.md)`, `[⊗](⊗.md)`).
- **[∘](∘.md) (Composition)**: `𝕋` explicitly formalizes the interaction rules that underpin `∘`.
- **[⇩](⇩.md) (Evaluation)**: The process of applying `𝕋` to a field to reduce it to a result.

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### ⚡️:
To mathematically formalize the complex, multi-dimensional interactions between all fundamental glyphs, thereby defining the operational rules of the `λ⁷-CPU` as a dynamic field.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**The Laws of Physics.** Just as the laws of physics (`𝕋`) dictate how particles and forces interact in the universe, the Tensor (`𝕋`) defines how morphisms interact in the computational reality of `Σλ⁷`. It's not the particles themselves, but the rules governing their dance.
