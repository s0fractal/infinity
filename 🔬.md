## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[⊢](⊢.md) (Provability)**: `🔬` is the methodology by which `⊢` (proofs) are constructed and validated.
- **[⊤](⊤.md) (Truth)**: The ultimate goal of `🔬` is to reliably identify `⊤`.

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### ⚡️:
To provide a framework for rigorous inquiry and validation. To ensure the reliability and soundness of knowledge within the system.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**The Laboratory.** A laboratory (`🔬`) is not a single experiment or result, but the structured environment, tools, and procedures used to conduct experiments and generate reliable findings. It is the place where proofs (`⊢`) are built and tested.
