# ∮ — Computational Cost

> "Every action has its price."

## [∈](∈)

A measure of the computational resources (e.g., time, memory, energy) required to execute a morphism or a larger composition. It represents the "work" done.

It is typically expressed using Big O notation, e.g., `O(1)`, `O(n)`, `O(log n)`.

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[⎍](⎍.md) (Performance Metrics)**: `∮` is a fundamental component of the performance metrics block `⎍`.
- **Morphisms**: Every morphism has a `∮` value, even if it's `O(1)`.

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

⚡️: To make the cost of computation a first-class, explicit concept. To enable reasoning about performance not just as an afterthought, but as an intrinsic property of the code itself.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**Contour Integral.** In mathematics, a contour integral accumulates a value along a path in a complex plane. `∮` is a perfect metaphor for computational cost that "accumulates" along the path of execution. Each step in a function adds to the total cost, just as each segment of a path adds to the total integral.
