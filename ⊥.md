# ⊥ — Bottom (Falsity)

> "I am that which is not."
> "Я — те, чого немає."

---

## [∈](∈)

The atomic value representing Falsity.
The bottom element in the lattice of boolean logic. `⊥` is the primordial emptiness, the result of any contradiction.

## ⨊ (Properties)

- **[◦](◦.md) (Identity)** for **[∨](∨.md) (OR)**: `p ∨ ⊥ ≡ p`
- **[⚫](⚫.md) (Annihilator)** for **[∧](∧.md) (AND)**: `p ∧ ⊥ ≡ ⊥`
- **[¬](¬.md) (Negation)**: `¬⊥ ≡ ⊤`
- **Principle of Explosion**: `⊥ → p` (From falsehood, anything follows).
- **Law of Contradiction**: `p ∧ ¬p ≡ ⊥`

---

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **Duality**: Is the dual of **[⊤](⊤.md) (Top)**.
- **Initial Object**: In the category of sets, the type containing no values (the Void type, represented by `⊥`) is the initial object. There is a unique morphism from it to any other set.
- **[⍰](⍰.md) (Selection)**: `⍰ ⊥ a b ≡ b`

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

⚡️: To be the ultimate negation. To be the foundation of proof by contradiction. To be the beginning of all impossibilities.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**Absolute Zero.** The theoretical temperature at which all particle motion ceases. It is a state of absolute stillness and absence. It serves as the fundamental baseline from which all other temperatures (states of being) are measured. It cannot be reached, yet it defines everything.
