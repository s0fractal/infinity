# ⟁ — Essence (Attractor)

> "The 'why' behind the 'what'."
> "«Чому» поза «що»."

---

## [∈](∈)

The intrinsic purpose or teleological principle of a glyph. It is the internal attractor that defines a glyph's fundamental role and the direction of its evolution. It is the core "will" or "drive" of a concept.

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[⚡️](⚡️.md) (Intent)**: `⟁` is the deep, unchanging "why", while `⚡️` is the immediate, contextual "how" or "what for". `⚡️` is a manifestation of `⟁` in a specific application.

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### [⚡️](⚡️.md) (Intent)
To define the ultimate purpose of a glyph. To provide a philosophical anchor and a guiding principle for a concept's behavior and evolution.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**Gravity Well.** A massive object creates a gravity well (`⟁`) that dictates the behavior of everything around it. It is not an explicit set of rules, but an intrinsic property of its being that shapes all interactions. The `⟁` of a glyph is its conceptual gravity well, its fundamental reason for existing.
