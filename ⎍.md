# ⎍ — Performance Metrics

> "The measure of behavior."

## [∈](∈)

A schema or container for non-functional properties that describe the behavior and cost of a morphism. It provides a standardized way to talk about performance.

---

## ⊃ (Schema Components)

The `⎍` block typically contains the following properties:

- **[⦾](⦾.md) (Purity)**: Is the function pure? (e.g., 1.0 for pure, 0.0 for impure).
- **[⏏](⏏.md) (Termination)**: Does the function always terminate?
- **[∮](∮.md) (Cost)**: The computational complexity (Time/Memory).
- **[☍](☍.md) (Arity)**: The number of inputs and outputs.

---

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

⚡️: To provide a complete picture of a morphism, beyond just its input/output transformation. To capture *how* a function behaves, not just *what* it does.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**A Car's Specification Sheet.** When you buy a car, you don't just care that it moves from A to B (`A → B`). You care about its performance metrics (`⎍`): its fuel efficiency (`∮`), its seating capacity (`☍`), its safety rating (`⦾` purity equivalent), and its reliability (`⏏` termination equivalent). `⎍` is the spec sheet for a function.
