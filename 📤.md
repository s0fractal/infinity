# 📤 — Export (Module Interface)

## ∈

A formal declaration of the public interface or functionalities provided by a module or a layer within the glyph system. It specifies the set of glyphs, functions, or data structures that are made available for external use, encapsulating internal implementation details.

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[⭘](⭘.md) (Base Layer)**: `⭘` uses `📤` to expose its fundamental morphisms.
- **[🏠](🏠.md) (Module)**: A `🏠` typically defines its `📤`.
- **Projection**: The `📤` is often projected into a file (e.g., `mod.ts`) that serves as the actual export mechanism in a target language.

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### ⚡️:
To formally establish the boundaries between internal implementation and external usage. To manage the flow of capabilities and information from a module to its consumers.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**A Shop Window.** A shop window (`📤`) displays the products available for purchase (the exported functionalities) without revealing the internal workings of the shop (the implementation details). It's the point of interaction between the producer and the consumer.
