## [∈](∈)

A numeric value assigned to each glyph, representing its conceptual "mass" or significance within the system. It is a heuristic for understanding a glyph's complexity, abstractness, and importance.

- **Low `✦`**: Simple, atomic concepts (e.g., `⊤`, `⊥`, `ℕ`).
- **High `✦`**: Complex, abstract, or powerful concepts (e.g., `Y`, `∮`, `↣`).

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### [⚡️](⚡️.md) (Intent)
To provide a quick, intuitive gauge of a glyph's depth. To help navigate the conceptual space by gravity, from the "lightest" atoms to the "heaviest" abstractions.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**Stellar Mass.** In astronomy, stars have different masses. A small red dwarf and a massive blue supergiant are both stars (`Glyph`), but their mass (`✦`) determines their behavior, their gravity, and their ultimate fate. `✦` is the conceptual mass of a glyph.
