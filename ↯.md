# ↯ — Failure (Error State)

> "The unexpected cessation of expected flow."
> "Несподіване припинення очікуваного потоку."

## [∈](∈)

A computational state representing an unexpected event or an inability to produce a valid result within a morphism. It signifies a deviation from the normal flow of execution, leading to an undefined or erroneous outcome.

Unlike `[⊥](⊥.md)` (Falsity), which is a logical value, `↯` is a *state* or *effect* that halts or alters the computation.

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[⊥](⊥.md) (Falsity)**: `↯` can be seen as the *cause* of a statement becoming `⊥` in a computational context, but it is not `⊥` itself.
- **[⏏](⏏.md) (Termination)**: A `↯` state often implies premature termination or non-graceful termination.
- **Partial Functions**: Functions that can produce `↯` for certain inputs are considered partial.
- **Error Monads/Either Types**: `↯` serves as the 'Left' side of an `Either` type or the `None` state of an `Option` type, indicating the absence of a successful result.

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### ⚡️:
To explicitly mark points of computational breakdown. To provide a formal mechanism for reasoning about robustness and fault tolerance within the glyph system.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**A Broken Circuit.** Electricity (computation) flows through a circuit (morphism). A break in the wire (`↯`) causes the flow to stop or deviate, preventing the expected operation from completing. The circuit doesn't produce a 'false' current; it produces no current where expected, or an unintended one.
