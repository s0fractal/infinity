# ⚡️ — Intent

> "The purpose of an action."
> "Мета дії."

---

## ∈

The specific, immediate purpose or goal of a morphism's application in a given context. It is the "reason for the call".

---

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[⟁](⟁.md) (Essence)**: `⚡️` is a contextual manifestation of a glyph's deeper `⟁`. If a glyph's `⟁` is "to create structure", its `⚡️` in a specific use case might be "to combine a key and a value into a pair".

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### [⚡️](⚡️.md) (Intent)
To make the purpose of every action explicit. To answer the question "What is this for?" for every transformation.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**A Vector.** A vector has both magnitude and direction. It describes a specific movement from A to B. It is not the object that moves, nor the landscape it moves through, but the specific *intent* of that one movement. `⚡️` is the vector of a function's application.
