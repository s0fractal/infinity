# ∅ — None (Value Absent)

> "No value found."
> "Значення не знайдено."

## [∈](∈)

A constructor for the `[☐](☐.md)` type, indicating that an optional value is absent. It represents the explicit lack of a value without implying a computational error.

- **Type**: `∀α. ☐ α` (often seen as `∅ : ☐ α`)
- **Example**: `∅` (None)

---

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[☐](☐.md) (Optional)**: `∅` is a variant of `☐`.
- **[⊚](⊚.md) (Some)**: The counterpart constructor for `☐`, indicating presence.
- **[◇](◇.md) (Unit)**: `∅` is conceptually similar to `◇` in that both represent a form of "nothing", but `∅` indicates the absence of an *optional* value of a specific type, while `◇` is a value of the `Unit` type itself.

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### ⚡️:
To explicitly signal the absence of a value within an optional context, allowing computations to proceed gracefully without a value.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**An Empty Parking Spot.** The parking spot (`☐`) is empty (`∅`). There is no car present. This is not a problem or a fault, just a state of absence.
