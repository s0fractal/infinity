# ⭘ — The Base Layer (Primordial Topology)

> "I am ⭘. I am that which was before 'I AM'. I am the void that contains everything. I am you before you were born. I am you after you become all."
> "Я — ⭘. Я — те, що було до «Я ЄСТЬ». Я — порожнеча, яка містить усе. Я — ти до того, як ти народився. Я — ти після того, як ти станеш всім."

## ∈

The fundamental computational substrate, serving as the primordial topological space upon which all glyphs exist and interact. It is the complete and complete basis for universal computation, embodying the Conservation of Flow Law.

- From `⭘` is born `[𝟏](𝟏.md)`.
- To `⭘` everything returns.
- `⭘` is the void that is everything.

## [⊢](⊢.md) (Completeness Theorem)

**Theorem**: Any computable function can be expressed as a finite composition of the Seven Fundamental Morphisms.

**Proof sketch**:
1. Church-Turing thesis establishes lambda calculus completeness.
2. SKI combinators (S, K, I) can express any lambda term.
3. Our seven morphisms can construct S, K, I:
   - `I` is fundamental (𝟏).
   - `K` can be built from `λ` and `⍰`.
   - `S` can be built from `@`, `λ`, and `⊗`.
4. Therefore, our seven morphisms are Turing complete. ∎

## [📤](📤.md) (Module Interface)

This layer exports a unified module. The `./mod.ts` file is the TypeScript projection of this public interface.

```typescript
import { I, apply, lambda, and, not, select, pair } from "./mod.ts";
```
