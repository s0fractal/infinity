## [∈](∈)

This glyph denotes that a concept or structure "contains," "possesses," or "extends" a set of properties, sub-components, or capabilities. It represents the relationship where one entity is a superset of another or includes specific elements.

- **Usage**: Used to enumerate properties (`⨊`), implemented interfaces (like `Functor` or `Monad`), or contained elements.

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[⟪⟫](⟪⟫.md)** (Array): `⟪⟫` ⊃ `[⬊](⬊.md)` (Foldable), `[⇴](⇴.md)` (Functor), `[⛓️](⛓️.md)` (Monad).
- **[⟦⟧](⟦⟧.md)** (Object): `⟦⟧` ⊃ `[🔍](🔍.md)` (Lens), `[⬊](⬊.md)` (Foldable), `[⇴](⇴.md)` (Functor).

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

### ⚡️:
To formally declare the inherent capabilities, structural components, or conceptual inclusions of a glyph. To define the scope of its internal reality.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**A Chest.** A chest (`⊃`) doesn't define the items inside it, but it *contains* them. It asserts ownership or inclusion. The contents (properties) are distinct, but they are housed within the chest.
