# ↣ — Morphism

> "A transformation that preserves structure."

## [∈](∈)

In category theory, a morphism is a structure-preserving map between two objects in a category. It is a generalization of a function. In this system, all transformations and operations are considered morphisms.

- **[λ](λ.md)**, **[@](@.md)**, **[⍰](⍰.md)** etc. are all instances of `↣`.

## 🔗 (Relations)

- **[∘](∘.md) (Composition)**: Morphisms can be composed. If `f: A → B` and `g: B → C` are morphisms, then their composition `g ∘ f` is a morphism from `A → C`.
- **[𝟏](𝟏.md) (Identity)**: For every object, there exists an identity morphism `𝟏` which is the neutral element for composition.
- **Category**: A category consists of objects and morphisms.

## 🌌 (Metaphysics)

⚡️: To be the fundamental unit of action and transformation. To provide a universal language for describing any process, from abstract logic to concrete computation.

### [⩓](⩓.md) (Analogy)
**A Train Ticket.** A ticket (`↣`) is not the journey itself, nor is it the origin or destination. It is the *permission* and the *plan* for a specific, structure-preserving journey between two stations (objects). It defines a valid path within the railway system (the category).
